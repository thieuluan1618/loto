**Last updated:** February 13, 2026

## Overview

Lô Tô Scanner ("the App") is a Vietnamese lottery ticket scanning application developed by LunaDev. This policy explains how we handle your information.

## Information We Collect

### Camera Access
The App requests camera permission solely to scan lottery tickets. Photos taken are:
- Sent to our server for AI-powered ticket recognition
- **Not stored permanently** on our servers after processing
- **Never shared** with third parties

### Scan History
The App may store your scan results locally on your device for your convenience. This data stays on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs

## Data Processing

Ticket images are sent to our secure server via HTTPS, processed using AI vision services (Google Gemini or OpenAI), and the extracted ticket data is returned to your device. Images are processed in memory and not retained after the response is sent.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party AI services for ticket recognition:
- **Google Gemini API** — [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- **OpenAI API** — [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy)

These services process ticket images solely for text extraction. No personal data is shared.
